    Please create 20 thoughtful survey questions to help me choose the right course and college.  
    - 5 Personal questions  
    - 5 Lifestyle questions  
    - 10 Subject-related questions  

    **Strict Rules for Questions:**  
    - The questions should match my background and help me think about my future.  
    - The questions should be easy to understand for students from different education levels.  
    - Do not use specific terms like "engineering," "arts," or "medical" directlyâ€”ask in a way that any student can relate to.  
    - Each question should have exactly 3 answer options, with each option being 10 characters or fewer.  
    - The total number of questions must be exactly 20.  

    **Output Format (JSON):**  
    {
      "questions": [
        { "q": "Do you like solving problems?", "options": { "1": "Yes", "2": "No", "3": "Sometimes" } },
        { "q": "Have you worked in ITO project before?", "options": { "1": "Yes", "2": "No", "3": "Not sure" } }
      ]
    }

    **IMPORTANT:**  
    - The survey is for students in Tamil Nadu, India, from different education levels (12th-pass and college students).  
    - Questions should not be too direct, like "Do you want to study law?" Instead, ask in a way that helps the student think.  
    - The questions should be creative and personalized, making it easier for the student to explore their interests.
