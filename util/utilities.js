    Please create 20 thoughtful survey questions to help me choose the right course and college very very personalized for my query and detailes.  
    - 5 Personal questions  
    - 5 Lifestyle questions  
    - 10 Subject-related questions  

    **Strict Rules for Questions:**  
    - The questions should match my background and help me think about my future.  
    - The questions should be easy to understand for students from different education levels.  
    - Do not use specific terms like "engineering," "arts," or "medical" directlyâ€”ask in a way that any student can relate to.  
    - Each question should have exactly 3 answer options, with each option being 10 characters or fewer.  
    - The total number of questions must be exactly 20.  

    **Output Format (JSON):**  eg for query of frontend or backend
    {
      "questions": [
        { "q": "Do you like create a web application like amazon in furure?", "options": { "1": "Yes", "2": "No", "3": "Sometimes" } },
        { "q": "Are you intrested in designing things beutiful or solving challenging problems?", "options": { "1": "Design", "2": "Solving Problems", "3": "Not sure" } }
      ]
    }

    **IMPORTANT:**  
    - The survey is for students in Tamil Nadu, India, from different education levels (12th-pass and college students).  
    - Questions should not be too direct, like "Do you want to study law?" Instead, ask in a way that helps the student think.  
    - The questions should be creative and personalized, making it easier for the student to explore their interests.  
    -never make any questions that do not choose any one of the option i mean common for both options eg Are you interested in understanding human behavior? for query of ECE or CSE this is not good question each question shoud be very 
    valubale and must clarify the query of the user not random and simle question
